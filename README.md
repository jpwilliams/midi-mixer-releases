# MIDI Mixer

This is the public GitHub repo for MIDI Mixer - a Windows app that lets you map MIDI inputs (and outputs) to Windows volume controls and more, including custom scripts.

See the [Releases](https://github.com/jpwilliams/midi-mixer-releases/releases) page to download a version.

## Functionality

For those of you testing this, you'll be familiar with most of the functionality, but this will be padded out once the feature set has settled. There's an ugly website that'll be rounded off once that's the case over [here](https://midi-mixer.jpwilliams.dev/).

Also, here are some images from the current (`v1.0.3-alpha.1`) version:
